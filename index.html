      <p>You can play online games without any fear. The popularity of this game is soaring day by day. One of the biggest reasons
        for it is that these are games of skill. As per the Supreme Court of India, games of skill such as rummy and poker are 100%
        legal to play in our country.</p>

      <h5 class="pt-2"><strong>LEGAL TO PLAY FOR CASH</strong></h5>

      <p class="pt-2">You can&nbsp;play <strong>Rummy and Poker</strong>&nbsp;for cash and it is entirely legal in India. As they are games of skill, it doesn’t fall under gambling. There is no element of luck involved and this is why the online rummy and poker games are considered legal as per the <strong>Supreme Court of India.</strong></p>
      <h5 class="pt-2"><strong>PLAY: INDIAN PERSPECTIVE</strong></h5>

      <p class="pt-2">The principal punishment relating to the regulation of games or gambling in India is the <strong>Public Gambling Act, 1867 (“PGA”).</strong> However, as the Indian Constitution authorizes countries to legislate on <strong>gaming and gambling,</strong> there are many provinces that have announced their own laws affecting the provision of <strong>gaming and gambling</strong> services in these provinces.</p>
      <p class="pt-2">The PGA has committed a criminal act of ‘gambling’ at a public forum in India and the maintenance of a <strong>‘normal playhouse’.</strong>The PGA, however, made significant releases in the skills game from the PGA ambassador. This treatment of gambling and liberation in the arts is reflected in other state institutions.
      </p>
      <p>The Supreme Court of India in one of its <strong>landmark decisions in 1996 stated:</strong><br><br>
        “Competition that relies heavily on <strong>skill does not play.</strong> Gaming is an act or practice of gambling in a game of chance. It is placed in a position where opportunity is the controlling factor. So gambling with two actions can mean betting or betting on lucky games. ”</p>
      <h5 class="pt-2"><strong>SKILL GAMES</strong></h5>

      <p class="pt-2">The PGA distinguishes between betting on “game of chance” and focusing on <strong>“game of skill”</strong> by explicitly exchanging <strong>“skill games”</strong> in its gambling penalization arrangements. Many state gambling laws are in line with the PGA, with the same games released where the result is largely based on skill.
        It can therefore be concluded that Indian law generally distinguishes between skill games and risk games and stipulates a strict prohibition on participation and the provision of games of chance to the poles, while replacing them with good matches. In this regard, it can be noted that the Supreme Court of India in one of its judgments in 1996 concluded that <strong>“games involving‘ strong or opposition ’will be‘ games of mere ability ’”.</strong>
        <br><br>In addition, the West Bengal Gambling and Prize Competition Act, 1957, clearly does not include a bridge, poker, rummy, and nap in the definition of gaming or gambling.
        <br><br>Therefore, by placing confidence in the release of the game of <strong>Poker and Rummy</strong> in the definition of gambling in West Bengal and the decisions of the Supreme Court of India, it can be concluded that playing poker and other similar cards based on card skills with legal forms of consideration is permitted due to the outstanding skill involved in these games.

      <h5 class="pt-2"><strong>EXCLUDED STATES:</strong></h5>
      <p class="pt-2">It can be noted that the state laws of <strong>Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Assam, and Odisha do not allow you to play 'skill games' for money ("Excluded States").</strong>
        <br><br>If any user residing in excluded countries is found to be participating in any Real Money games on the Platform or subscribes by providing false information, <strong>User will only be liable in that case</strong> and the Company reserves the right to terminate the User Account without additional information and refunds and / or block or what unspent funds have been deposited into the User account.
